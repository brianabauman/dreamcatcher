He was carrying a handgun, but wasn't pointing it at me. When I approached him, he began to walk towards me. I reached to grab the gun, and was able to pry it from him. Pointing it at him, I demanded that he leave, but he refused.",

She found a hole in the wall and escpaed into the farm. I went looking for her and eventually found her with a local farm dog. They had somehow managed to have a baby together in the few hours that she was missing. The baby had the body of a dog and the head of a cat.",

As soon as my body submerged, I rushed to reach for the phone in my pocket and raise it above the water level. I knew it had already been completely submerged, but felt like there was still a chance to save it if I acted quickly. After wading to the shore with the phone held above my head, I confirmed it was still working.",
